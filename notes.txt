Name Entity Recognization (NER)

Application : 1. Resume parser/ATS
                 (Information from the Job Description ), Extract meaningful information from the Resume
                 and check the similarity of both. 
                 similarity metrics generally used are: Cosine similarity
    
    Example: Bill gates is a founder of Microsoft
             Bill (B-Person) gates (I-Person) is (O) a (O) founder (Designation) of (O) Microsoft (Organization)
           (B-Person) (I-Person)

ATS: Information may needs to be extract: Based on Job Description (Experience, based on role) 
     Match with JD and check the cosine similarity (Let say: Cutoff is 70% or 80%)


     Step1. Create a new Git hub repository

     #NLP use case here: Token classification
          Bert based model can be used with PyTorch 
          (PyTorch easy of writing code and understand) whereas Tensorflow requires more line of code
          #Installing Cuda (better 12.1) is required

PyTorch installation:
# pip install torch  --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu


workflow:
1. Template creation
2. Activate environment ( conda activate nerproject)
3. Install Requirements and Setup
4.
